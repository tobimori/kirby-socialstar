**SocialStar** connects your Kirby site with third-party social media platforms. Posts from Instagram or YouTube are synced as read-only pages to your Kirby site.

In Kirby terms, SocialStar is simply supplying custom Page models and Blueprints - which makes it very easy to extend. Want to make a Linktree-like site that allows you to add links to any of your Instagram posts? Just extend the blueprint, add your own fields and you're good to go.
