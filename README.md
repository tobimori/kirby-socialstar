# SocialStar for Kirby

**SocialStar** connects your Kirby site with third-party social media platforms. Posts from **Instagram** or **YouTube** are synced as read-only pages to your Kirby site.

In Kirby terms, SocialStar is simply supplying custom Page models and Blueprints - which makes it very easy to extend. Want to make a Linktree-like site that allows you to add links to any of your Instagram posts? Just extend the blueprint, add your own fields and you're good to go.

Read more about SocialStar on the [official plugin website](https://plugins.andkindness.com/socialstar).

SocialStar requires Kirby 5+ and PHP 8.3+. You are responsible to supply your own API keys for each connected social media platform.

## License

Kirby SocialStar is not free software. In order to run it on a public server, you'll have to purchase a valid Kirby license & a [valid SocialStar license](https://plugins.andkindness.com/socialstar/pricing).
